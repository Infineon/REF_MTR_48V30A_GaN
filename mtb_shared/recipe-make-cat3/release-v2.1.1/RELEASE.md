# XMC GNU make Build System Release Notes
This repo provides the build recipe make files and scripts for building and programming XMC applications. Builds can be run either through a command-line interface (CLI) or through the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox.

### What's Included?
This release of the XMC GNU make build recipe includes support for building XMC application projects. It is expected that a code example contains a top level make file for itself and references a Board Support Package (BSP) that defines specific items, like the XMC part, for the target board. Supported functionality includes the following:

* Supported operations:
    * Build
    * IDE Integration (Eclipse, VS Code, IAR, uVision)
* Supported toolchains:
    * GCC
    * IAR
    * ARM Compiler 6

### What Changed?
#### v2.1.1.
* Minor updates to IDE export.

#### v2.0.0
* Major version update. Significant changes to support ModusToolbox 3.0
* Dropped compatibility with core-make version 1.X and ModusToolbox tools version 2.X

#### v1.2.0
* Added ARM and IAR support (IAR linker scripts are shipped with IAR EW)

#### v1.1.0
* Added support for generating tgz file for Infineon online simulator (core-make-1.8.0 or newer)
* Added support for opening Infineon online simulator through quick panel (core-make-1.8.0 or newer)

#### v1.0.0
* Initial production release

#### v0.5.0
* Initial pre-production release

### Product/Asset Specific Instructions
Builds require that the ModusToolbox tools be installed on your machine. This comes with the ModusToolbox install. On Windows machines, it is recommended that CLI builds be executed using the Cygwin.bat located in ModusToolBox/tools\_x.y/modus-shell install directory. This guarantees a consistent shell environment for your builds.

To list the build options, run the "help" target by typing "make help" in CLI. For a verbose documentation on a specific subject type "make help CY\_HELP={variable/target}", where "variable" or "target" is one of the listed make variables or targets.
